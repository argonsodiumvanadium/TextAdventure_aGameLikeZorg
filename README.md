# TextAdventure_aGameLikeZorg
This is a terminal based game like the original and amazing game zorg I tried some oop principles on this and it was amazing I 
mean oop for life but it got fudged up at the end, so it is something I made to learn oop and to make you pass your time (gui 
edition will come soon (soon means 3-4 months(lot to do))) so I will cut to the chase
Important things :-
i  )Use wipe before everything else so that the txt files are emptied and save can work 
ii )place the txt files WITH the java file and be sure that no restrictions are there in access
iii)Please give some feedback so it might help (My code is super messed up)





Phew !! well rest is just a 2 line docs
okay I am done I mean this code was something I started to increse my ability in writing with oop and man! I fell in love with 
oop I mean I used to be a die hard pop fanboy but it kinda got messed up in my Bank.java file eventhough the ui was decent so I 
started oop because java is oop and holy it was better because I could just make a room and close it down, this lead to a 
variety of other things I can do and i saw things I could do so yah
