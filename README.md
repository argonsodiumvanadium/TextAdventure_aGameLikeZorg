# TextAdventure_aGameLikeZorg
This is a terminal based game like the original and amazing game zorg I tried some oop principles on this and it was amazing I 
mean oop for life but it got fudged up at the end, so it is something I made to learn oop and to make you pass your time (gui 
edition will come soon (soon means 3-4 months(lot to do))) so I will cut to the chase
Important things :-
     i  )Use wipe before everything else so that the txt files are emptied and save can work 
     ii )place the txt files WITH the java file and be sure that no restrictions are there in access
     iii)Please give some feedback so it might help (My code is super messed up)
